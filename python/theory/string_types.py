greeting = "Hello, Python!"  # String Literals ,Immutability like Java

first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name  # String Concatenation

text = "Hello, Python!"
first_char = text[0]  # Accessing the first character
sub_string = text[7:13]  # Slicing to get "Python"


name = 'James'
age = 36
print('My name is {} and I am {} years old'.format(name, age))
# this is the best and easy way to give a different type in print or:

# first type 'f' then start your string and by opening and closing {} that called "placeholder"
print(f'My name is {name} and I am {age} years old')
# so wih comma you can give a different type in print
print('Python', 3, 'is awesome:', True)
