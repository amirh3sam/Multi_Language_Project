# In Python, you declare variables by directly assigning a value to a name. Python is dynamically typed, so you
# don't need to specify the data type explicitly.

# Declaring a variable
my_number = 42  # in python need to initial too otherwise you are getting error

# Declaring and initializing in one line
another_number = 10

# Variable names are case-sensitive
myNumber = 5

# You can reassign variables with a different type
my_number = "Hello, Python!"
